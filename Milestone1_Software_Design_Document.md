# You are currently working toward building a full stack web application for your client, Travlr Getaways. It is important to think about the overall system view of how all the pieces of the web app will come together to be a fully functioning website, which will include a customer-facing website, a database, and an admin single-page application that all need to work together.

# Web applications are an inherently complicated undertaking because of the variety of complex technologies that must work together seamlessly and scale up to support thousands of connections in a short time frame. As part of your deliverables to the client, Travlr Getaways, you will need to prepare documentation to explain your process and the various components associated with the full stack web app.

# It's best practice to document your plan for full stack development as you progress through a project. The Software Design Document (SDD) is an engineering document that contains technical specifications and some written descriptions and explanations. You will complete several components of the SDD in Milestone One.

# This milestone is intended for you to begin preparing the design documentation needed to deliver to your client, Travlr Getaways. Specifically, you will provide a high-level overview, a description of the design constraints, and a diagram that demonstrates the architecture of the web app. Keep your audience in mind and be sure to communicate clearly and concisely in client-facing documentation. Complete the following sections of the Software Design Document for your client:

# Executive Summary: An executive summary is used to introduce the software design problem and present a solution. Be sure to provide the client with any critical information they must know in order to proceed with the process you are proposing. It will be essential to address the following in the Executive Summary section of the SDD:


# Design Constraints: Building an application has constraints. These constraints are things that provide boundaries or guardrails for the project and naturally come with limitations. Be sure to address the following in the Design Constraints section of the SDD:

    Identify the design constraints for developing the web-based Travlr Getaways application.
    Explain the implications of the design constraints on the application development.

# System Architecture View: Component Diagram: A component diagram has already been created for you. Review the diagram provided and address the following in the System Architecture: Component Diagram section of the SDD:

    Describe the overall system architecture of the web application by referring to the component diagram provided in the SDD.
    Identify the significant components that will be used and their relationship to one another.

Please note: You will continue to add diagrams and complete additional sections of the Software Design Document throughout the course as you develop each aspect of the full stack web application.
